MovementController

Based on https://github.com/Droivox/Godot-Engine-FPS 
This project includes code for several movement combinations, all can be edited from the character scene. 

You can find the scenes you can add to the character scene in res://data/player/components/ these can be either passive or tactical.
Example: <p align='center'>

To activate the "tactical" nodes you use the middle button of the mouse.
